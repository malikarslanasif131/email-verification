# Email Verification with Node.js, Express.js, and Nodemailer

This project is an example of how to implement email verification for user registration in a Node.js application using Express.js and Nodemailer. When a user registers, an email with a verification link is sent to their provided email address. Users can then verify their account by clicking the verification link.

## Features

- User registration with name and email.
- Email verification with a time-limited verification link.
- Automatic removal of unverified accounts after a certain time period.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or any other database of your choice)
- Nodemailer for sending emails
- HTML and CSS for email templates

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have the following software and services installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (or a compatible database)
- A Gmail account for sending verification emails (or other SMTP email service)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-verification.git
   cd email-verification
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Define the following environment variables in your `.env` file:
     ```
     DB=your-mongodb-connection-string
     HOST=your-smtp-hostname
     USER=your-smtp-username
     PASS=your-smtp-password
     SERVICE=your-smtp-service
     BASE_URL=http://localhost:your-port/api
     PORT=your-port
     ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The API will be available at `http://localhost:your-port/api`.

## Usage

1. Register a new user by sending a POST request to `/api/user` with a JSON body containing `name` and `email` fields. The server will send a verification email to the provided email address.

2. Check your email for the verification link and click on it to verify your account.

3. If the verification link is not clicked within a certain time (5 minutes by default), the unverified user account is automatically removed.

## Customization

You can customize the email templates by modifying the HTML content in the email sending function. Additionally, you can adjust the verification link expiration time in the code.
